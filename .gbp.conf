[DEFAULT]
# This postexport hook is used to replace the default chromium.tar file
# generated with `git archive' (and which only contains the contents of
# chromium.git) with a full-blown tar file that contains all source code
# required to build Chromium. Additionally, the new tar file's members all
# contain their original mtimes, which is helpful if one wants to try an
# incremental Tizen build. The script is run from the temporary directory
# containing the contents of packaging/ that are used by git-buildpackage.
